😊 Emoji Creation by Detecting Facial Emotions

 📌 Overview

This project detects facial emotions using deep learning and automatically maps them to corresponding emojis in real-time.
It enhances human-computer interaction by providing a visual, expressive response based on the user's facial expression captured through a webcam.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect real-time facial emotions using a webcam.
- Map each detected emotion to a relevant emoji.
- Display the emoji as an expressive feedback mechanism.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion classification



## 🧠 Core Features

- 📷 Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- 😄 Emotion classification into categories like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.
- 🧩 Emoji mapping and live display alongside detected face



## 🧪 How It Works

1. Capture video input from the webcam.
2. Detect faces using Haar cascades.
3. Preprocess and feed the face region into a trained CNN model.
4. Predict the emotion and display the corresponding emoji overlay.



## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple faces.
- Enhance accuracy using larger datasets or advanced models (e.g., ResNet).
- Integrate with chat or virtual assistant systems for richer interaction.



Additional Requirements:
opencv-python
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib

 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013)** dataset, which contains thousands of labeled facial expression images.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the dataset is **not included in this repository**.

🔽 You can download the dataset from:

- [Kaggle – FER2013 Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

### 📌 Steps to Use:
1. Create a Kaggle account  (https://www.kaggle.com/) if you don't already have one.
2. Go to the dataset page linked above.
3. Click on the **Download** button.
4. Extract the files and place them in your project directory's folder named `dataset/`.
5. Make sure your code points to the correct path where the data is stored.
