😊 Emoji Creation by Detecting Facial Emotions

 📌 Overview

This project detects facial emotions using deep learning and automatically maps them to corresponding emojis in real-time.
It enhances human-computer interaction by providing a visual, expressive response based on the user's facial expression captured through a webcam.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect real-time facial emotions using a webcam.
- Map each detected emotion to a relevant emoji.
- Display the emoji as an expressive feedback mechanism.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion classification

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 📷 Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- 😄 Emotion classification into categories like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.
- 🧩 Emoji mapping and live display alongside detected face
- 💾 Option to save snapshots (optional extension)

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Capture video input from the webcam.
2. Detect faces using Haar cascades.
3. Preprocess and feed the face region into a trained CNN model.
4. Predict the emotion and display the corresponding emoji overlay.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple faces.
- Enhance accuracy using larger datasets or advanced models (e.g., ResNet).
- Integrate with chat or virtual assistant systems for richer interaction.
